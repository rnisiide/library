# library
TOP assignment - creating a library!

I have started this project in 2022. After some real life issues and a long hiatus, I am back to The Odin Project and restarting my web development skills.

After two years away from coding, it took a while refreshing what I had learned previously and also re-reading the code I had developed so far.
Some things didn't make sense at first, so I started organizing the ideas again, and wrote some of the functions from scratch so that they would make sense again.
